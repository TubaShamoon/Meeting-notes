## Rules and ethics 
Time sheets will be provided by Rimsha on each payroll

Time sheets will be provided in "Revelteck operations"

payrolls takes place every two week, first payroll starts from 1st Monday and ends on Second sunday, we start working on payrolls on 15th day of payroll.

I need to check the hours in the time sheet, if someone messed up with the timer 

sometimes employees forget to turn off the timer, if there's a mistake like this consider only 8h, not more than this.

Messed up time should be minus from the total working hours, 

Employees are allowed to work 80 hour till the end of every payroll, if they don't have permission to over time consider only 80h.

Breaks are really important if someone skipping break, they will be charged with minus 1 working hour(deduction in salary).

Bonuses depends on the finance team when they want to relize the bonus, they can do it every 2 week or can be decided on last friday meeting.

When sending the crypto always add 0.5 amount in it.

Company's follows M/D/Y pattern follow it accordingly
